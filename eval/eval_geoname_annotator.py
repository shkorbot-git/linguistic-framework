Asked to confirm the death of doctor Abraham Borbor, Brown said: "That is correct. He died yesterday [24 Aug 2014]." (Reuters Reporting by Emma Farge; Editing by Daniel Flynn) http://in.mobile.reuters.com/article/idINL5N0QV21A20140825?irpc=932 T-705 Japan ------------- 25 Aug 2014: Japan to name criteria before offering unapproved EVD drug. Japan could offer an unapproved drug under certain circumstances to help treat the deadly ebolavirus, Reuters said. "Medical professionals could make a request for T-705 in an emergency even before a decision by the World Health Organization (WHO)," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. "In that case, we would like to respond under certain criteria." Tokyo will cooperate with the WHO and is ready to make an international contribution. Japan's Fujifilm Holdings Corp and US's MediVector are in talks with the US Food and Drug Administration to submit an application to expand the use of the influenza drug T-705, or favipiravir, as a treatment for EVD. http://investmentwatchblog.com/ebola-cure-japan-ready-to-offer-experimental-drug/#bd3TYhFSat70tJ0r.99 -- 25 Aug 2014: It is not clear whether T-705 (or Avigan) will actually work against EVD, and no monkey or human trials of the drug have been done, the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo reports. T-705 was developed by Japan's Toyama Chemicals company for use against new strains of influenza. It was approved by the Japanese government earlier this year [2014, without any human trials? - Mod.JW]. A company spokesman says the firm believes the similarity between flu viruses and ebolaviruses means Avigan could be effective [They are both single-stranded negative-sense RNA (ribonucleic acid) viruses. - Mod.JW]. http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28925491 WHO meeting ------------ 24 Aug 2014: The World Health Organization is scheduled to hold a meeting in Geneva next week with more than 100 experts, including 20 from West Africa, to discuss potential therapies and vaccines for the ebolavirus and explore ways to expedite clinical trials and ramp up production of the most promising treatments. The meeting should be sure to consider the use of drugs that are already approved for other diseases and are readily available. There are currently no approved drugs to treat infection with ebolaviruses and only a handful of potential drug therapies in the very earliest stages of testing in humans or animals, with little likelihood that they could be produced on a large scale any time soon. The new proposal would fill the gap by using drugs that have already been approved to treat other diseases and repurposing them to treat EVD as well. This approach is well worth pursuing, given the crisis; 2 broad categories of drugs are being mentioned. Existing drugs that seek to disable the viruses responsible for other diseases, for example, might conceivably disable ebolaviruses. And drugs that temper the body's response to other diseases by reducing severe inflammation might also dampen the often fatal inflammatory response in EVD patients. An advantage to using existing drugs is that they have been tested for safety and are often available in large quantities and produced as cheaper generics. If they could be offered to infected people in Africa, it might encourage patients to go get treatment instead of hiding from the authorities, and it might bolster the confidence of health care workers who are fleeing from hospitals in droves. There are also disadvantages. Just because a drug is effective against one disease does not mean it would work against EVD. It is possible that some drugs might actually harm EVD patients by making their infection worse or by causing severe side effects. One expert warns that EVD infection progresses rapidly within the body and that a drug that helps on Day 2 might become harmful by Day 7. That is why even approved drugs should be administered in clinical trials to determine whether they work against EVD. Though it would not be easy to conduct such trials, several experts have said they think it could and should be done. The idea of using approved drugs was proposed in an Op-Ed article in The Times on 16 Aug 2014; 30 respected clinical investigators and epidemiologists around the world are on record as supporting the article. Other experts have expressed reservations and have called for drug tests in nonhuman primates 1st. Even those who have backed the use of existing drugs because "desperate situations justify desperate measures" have stressed that there needs to be some evidence a drug might work. Beyond this, the primary need right now is supportive care, like keeping patients hydrated, which allows many to recover even without a drug treatment. This requires that hospitals and clinics have isolation units for the patients and protective gear for doctors and nurses to prevent the spread of the virus. Once such facilities exist, it should be possible to compare one group of patients given standard supportive care with another group given supportive care plus a drug that might help them. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org> ****** [2] Prevention, suspected cases Bolivia ------- 24 Aug 2014: Authorities say they are investigating a 1st potential case of EVD in Bolivia. The patient, whose name and age were not given, had made stopovers in several cities in Africa, Santa Cruz health service manager Roberto Torres told Oxigeno online. "Yesterday [23 Aug 2014], we had a report from a private hospital on an Indian [national] who is being treated for fever, diarrhoea and vomiting," he said. The health ministry in South America's poorest nation just 10 days ago set rules on early detection of potentially infected people. http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/08/24/bolivia-patient-isolated-ebola-check Guinea-Bissau -------------- 25 Aug 2014: Government accompanies closure of borders Bissau - A delegation composed of the Ministers of Health, Home Affairs and National Defence completed a tour of the interior of the country, in the eastern and southern borders of Guinea-Bissau. http://jornaldigital.com/noticias.php?noticia=43033 [in Portuguese] India ----- 25 Aug 2014: EVD alert as flight with over 100 passengers from Liberia headed for Mumbai. "We have been told that 116 passengers are suspected of EVD exposure," BMC's [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation] additional municipal commissioner Sanjay Deshmukh said. ... "Right now, we are focusing on creating beds for suspected cases. Isolation chambers are not immediately possible." ... In terms of protection to the medical staff who will handle suspected or confirmed EVD patients, the BMC already has as many as 600 body suits for staffers and doctors to wear. (AP) http://indianexpress.com/article/india/maharashtra/bmc-on-alert-after-receiving-report-of-flight-transporting-over-100-liberia-passengers-exposed-to-ebola/ Senegal -------- 25 Aug 2014: Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], was supposed to fly to West Africa on Mon [25 Aug 2014] to gauge the effects of the world's worst EVD outbreak. Then, his flight was canceled. Brussels Airlines was forced to halt flights to the affected region after Senegal's refusal this weekend to allow the Belgium-based carrier to touch down in Dakar for crew changes. ... The flight situation also has proven a burden for the WHO delegation now visiting Freetown. The team members were supposed to fly out on Brussels Air. On Monday [25 Aug 2014], there was word that the airline was negotiating with another country to access so crew changes could be made. Maybe flights would resume. But, in the meantime, the WHO officials were grounded. They hoped a small UN plane might become available. http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/alarm-grows-as-ebola-outbreak-spurs-more-flight-cancellations-border-closures/2014/08/25/87e6d020-2c66-11e4-994d-202962a9150c_story.html -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org> ****** [3] Alerts Ghana ----- Organisers of the Big Brother Africa competition have allegedly rejected the candidates selected to represent Ghana at the contest. ... Sources at Endemol, producers of the BBA show, said the 4 candidates who made it through the selection stage in Ghana were rejected because of the EVD scare in the West African sub-region. An official revealed that fresh auditions are being held to select new Ghanaian candidates for the popular TV reality show of the continent. The new audition is only opened to Ghanaian nationals living in South Africa as a precautionary measure. ... It is expected that the same thing will be done for candidates from all of West Africa, especially countries where the Ebola virus disease has been recorded. http://www.faceofmalawi.com/2014/08/big-brother-africa-rejects-west-african-candidates-over-ebola-scare/#sthash.WjDLsGxe.dpuf [There have been no reports of EVD in Ghana, so the TV producers are needlessly worried. - Mod.JW] Malawi ------ 25 Aug 2014: Malawi police arrested 52 Ethiopians.

In a press statement, it said in spite of denial by Sawyer, who described himself as a Senior Diplomat from Liberia, adequate measures were taken, which included isolating the patient, implementing barrier nursing and contacting the Lagos State Ministry of Health and the Federal Ministry of Health. It said, "A 40-year-old gentleman came into the hospital with symptoms suggestive of malaria (fever, headache, extreme weakness) on Sun 20 Jul 2014. He was fully conscious and gave us his clinical history and told us he is a Senior Diplomat from Liberia. Laboratory investigations confirmed malaria, whilst other tests for HIV, hepatitis B and C were negative. He was admitted, and treatment commenced. However, due to the fact that he was not responding to treatment but rather was developing haemorrhagic symptoms, we further questioned him. He denied having been in contact with any persons with EVD at home, in any hospital, or at any burial." Having treated [him] for malaria with no significant improvement, the management carried out tests for possible infectious haemorrhagic disease, especially EVD, based on the fact that he was from Liberia, which had recently witnessed an EVD outbreak. It said: "We refused for him to be let out of the hospital in spite of intense pressure, as we were told that he was a senior ECOWAS official and had an important role to play at the ECOWAS convention in Calabar, Cross River State. The initial test results from LUTH [Lagos University Teaching Hospital] laboratory indicated a signal of possible ebolavirus but required confirmation. We then took the further step of reaching out to Senior Officials in the office of the Secretary of Health of the United States of America, who promptly assisted us with contacts at the Centres for Disease Control [and Prevention] and the World Health Organization Regional Laboratory Centre in Senegal." "Working jointly with the State, Federal Agencies and International Agencies, we were able to obtain confirmation of ebolavirus (Zaire strain), (WHO Regional Center Lab-Senegal/Redeemers [University] lab/LUTH Laboratory). He afterwards died on 25 Jul 2014 at about 6.50 am. All agencies were promptly notified, and, in consultation with WHO, the Regional Ebola Virus Disease Centre in Conakry, Guinea and Best Practices, we commenced temporary shut down of the hospital with immediate evacuation of in-house patients. The appropriate professional removal of the body and its incineration under WHO guidelines, witnessed by all appropriate agencies, was carried out. In keeping with WHO guidelines, the hospital has been shut down briefly as a full decontamination exercise is currently in progress. We hope that by our action of preventing this gentleman from being extracted from our hospital and traveling to Calabar, we have been able to prevent the spread of Ebola virus disease in Nigeria." http://www.punchng.com/news/ebola-first-consultant-hospital-speaks-on-late-sawyer 24 Aug 2014: Striking doctors will resume work In Nigeria, striking doctors will resume work on Mon [25 Aug 2014] following an intervention by Senate President David Mark, according to Dr. Lawan Musa, leading member of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA). Musa says Mark promised the group that the government was willing to address their concerns. Officials of the NMA say the 2-month old strike was suspended due to the EVD emergency, while negotiations with the government continue. ... "This strike started even before the EVD [outbreak], and immediately the Nigeria Medical Association ordered all doctors in the states that were affected [to go back to work]; precisely Lagos and Anambra [states] were the 1st to be given the order that they should attend to issues pertaining to EVD," said Musa. "There were a lot of doctors that were part of the control team despite the ongoing strike." http://m.voanews.com/a/nigerian-doctors-suspend-strike/2426757.html Contact tracing failing ------------- 25 Aug 2014: ... There's no solid number of how many contacts have gone missing. Petersen said the CDC arrived at the 40-60 percent number because in some communities, each sick person has only listed an average of 2 contacts, and households commonly have 5 or 6 people. Mirkovic, an officer with the CDC's epidemic intelligence service, said when she and her team felt patients weren't being honest, they would try to get information from neighbors or community leaders. Sometimes that helped, and sometimes it didn't. "Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do," she said. "We can't force them" to give contacts. The World Health Organization estimates that 10 percent of contacts will go on to develop symptoms of EVD. Occasionally, some of these EVD cases go missing as well. Mirkovic, who left Guinea at the end of July [2014], said she felt that the situation might improve as health care workers gain more trust in the community. But there's another problem with that: the availability of workers to follow up with contacts. For example, in Sierra Leone, there are 2000 contacts that need following, but the group Doctors without Borders [MSF] says they've only been able to follow up about 200 of them. The group's teams in Sierra Leone and Liberia are "stretched to the breaking point," as the epidemic is "spiraling out of control," the group wrote in a press release. http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/25/health/ebola-contact-tracing/?c=&page=0 -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org> [The stories about Ghana and Malawi reveal basic misunderstanding about which countries are currently known to be infected by EVD.
